"MY WIFE AND I PURCHASED A NEW HONDA ACCORD TO BE USED BY OUR 21-YEAR OLD SON WHO IS ATTENDING COLLEGE AT BRIGHAM YOUNG UNIVERSITY.  ON SATURDAY, DEC. 15, 2001 HE ALONG WITH 3 OTHER COLLEGE STUDENTS WERE IN THE CAR ON THE FREEWAY.  THEY WERE TRAVELING IN THE FAST LANE AT AROUND 70 MILES PER HOUR., ANOTHER CAR GOING THE SAME DIRECTION LOST CONTROL (REASON UNKNOWN), SPUN OUT ACROSS THE FREEWAY, HIT THE CENTER DIVIDER AND STOPPED DIRECTLY IN THE PATH OF OUR SON.  NATURALLY HE HIT HIS BRAKES, BUT IT HAPPENED SO FAST THAT THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO EXCEPT HIT THE OTHER CAR HEAD-ON AT ABOUT 60 MILES PER HOUR.  ALL FOUR OF THE PARTIES IN OUR CAR WERE WEARING THEIR SEAT BELTS, WHICH PROBABLY SAVED THEIR LIVES.  HOWEVER, THE AIR BAGS DID NOT DEPLOY.  IT IS A MIRACLE THAT SOMEONE WASN'T SEVERLY INJURED.  WHILE ALL OF THE PARTIES HAD SOME WHIP LASH, NO ONE HAD TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL.  SOMEONE TOLD MY SON THAT BECAUSE HE HIT HIS BRAKES THE FRONT END OF OUR HONDA WAS LOWERED AND WENT UNDERNEATH THE BUMPER OF THE CAR THEY HIT, WHICH WAS A LARGER SUV AND THATS WHY THE AIRBAGS DIDN'T DEPLOY.  I THOUGHT AIRBAGS DEPLOYED ON IMPACT TO PROVIDE THE PROTECTION THEY ARE DESIGNED TO PROVIDE.  THE POLICE REPORT INDICATED THAT THE DRIVER OF THE SUV WHO SPUN OUT WAS AT FAULT.

"THIS IS NOT SO MUCH A FAILURE AS A QUESTION/SUGGESTION ABOUT WHAT REGULATIONS ARE IN PLACE FOR US STANDARDS OF REAR TAILLIGHT ASSEMBLIES.  A LOT OF MANUFACTURES HAVE GONE TO USING RED TURN SIGNALS THAT ALSO SERVE AS BRAKE LIGHTS.  THE PROBLEM I HAVE, AND I'M SURE THIS HAS CAUSED ACCIDENTS, IS THAT WHEN SOMEONE IS INDICATING A TURN 90% OF THE TIME THEY MUST BRAKE TO DO SO.  BUT THE ACT OF BRAKING OBSCURES THE TURN INDICATOR.  WHEN ONE TURNS THEY DROP A LOT MORE SPEED THEN SOMEONE BRAKING WITH TRAFFIC.  THE UNIFORMLY RED TURN/BRAKE LIGHT ASSEMBLIES CAN CAUSE CONFUSION AMONG DRIVERS BEHIND THE TURNING VEHICLE AND LEAD TO MISINTERPRETATION OF THE DRIVERS INTENTION AND LEAD TO ACCIDENTS.  HAS ANY STUDY BEEN DONE INVOLVING REAR-END ACCIDENTS INVOLVING TURNING VEHICLES?  THERE IS PROBABLY A HIGHER % INVOLVING VEHICLES WITH RED REAR-TURN SIGNALS.  IM HOPING THAT THE NHTSA WILL PERFORM A STUDY REGARDING RED TURN SIGNALS AND PROPOSE NEW REGULATIONS THAT REQUIRE AUTOMAKERS TO USE YELLOW LENSES FOR ALL REAR-TURN SIGNALS.  ANOTHER ISSUE WITH THEM IS WHEN THE VEHICLES HAZARD LIGHTS ARE ON.  HAVING BLINKING YELLOW LIGHTS WILL ALERT DRIVERS MUCH QUICKER TO THE PRESENCE OF A DISABLED VEHICLE THAN BLINKING RED LIGHTS.  THE RED LIGHTS WILL BLEND IN WITH ANY OTHER VEHICLE BRAKING TO SLOW DUE TO THE HAZARD.

AND DEALERSHIP SAYS THIS IS NORMAL NOISE AND QUITE A FEW OF THESE 2001 HONDA CIVIC'S HAVE THIS PROBLEM. THEY SAY IT IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT AFTER SOME DISC PAD WEAR THE CLEARANCE BETWEEN THE CALIPER PISTON AND THE PAD IS INCREASED SO THAT IS WHERE THE NOISE IS COMING FROM. I AM WORRIED ABOUT BINDING OF THE PAD OR THE PAD CRACKING DUE TO THE CONSTANT HAMMER OF THE PISTON INTO THE DISC BRAKE PAD. PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS AS I FEEL THIS IS A TIME BOMB WAITING TO GO OFF.

I HAD TO CARRY IT TO THE DEALER SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE THEY KEPT IT FOR A WEEK BEFORE THEY FINALLY FOUND THAT THE TRANSMISSION WAS DEFECTIVE.  THIS WAS DANGEROUS BECAUSE WHEN I WAS AT A STOP, AND HIT THE GAS TO ACCELERATE IT WOULD JUMP INTO GEAR AFTER A FEW SECONDS AND SOMETIMES WHEN I WAS DRIVING IT WOULD SLIP OUT OF GEAR NO MATTER THE SPEED I WAS DRIVING.

"ON OCTOBER-9-2001 MY FIANCÉ [XXX] AND I PURCHASED A 2001 HONDA CIVIC EX [XXX] FROM ROBERTS AUTO MALL IN DOWNINGTOWN, PA.  WE PURCHASED A HONDA BECAUSE WE DESIRED A CAR THAT WAS DEPENDABLE AND ONE THAT WOULD BE USED FOR MY FIANCÉS COMMUTE AND FOR DRIVING LONG DISTANCES. IN AUGUST OF 2002, THE CAR OVERHEATED ON A JOURNEY FROM ONEONTA, NY, TO PHOENIXVILLE, PA.  THE CAR WAS BROUGHT TO THE HONDA OF ITHACA DEALERSHIP.  AT THIS POINT, THE CAR WAS STILL UNDER WARRANTY, BEING UNDER A YEAR AFTER TIME OF PURCHASE WITH 18,717 MILES.  HONDA OF ITHACA, NEW YORK DETERMINED THE PROBLEM TO BE THE THERMOSTAT.  DESPITE THE OBVIOUS INCONVENIENCE THAT THIS BREAKDOWN CAUSED, WE WERE HAPPY THE PROBLEM WAS RESOLVED WHILE THE CAR WAS UNDER WARRANTY. IN DECEMBER 2003 ON A TRIP FROM PHOENIXVILLE, PA TO HOLMDEL, NJ THE CAR AGAIN OVERHEATED.  A LOCAL MECHANIC DETERMINED THE PROBLEM TO BE THE THERMOSTAT.  NO LONGER UNDER WARRANTY, THE THERMOSTAT WAS REPLACED AT A COST TO US OF $106.43.  ON FEBRUARY-4-2004 THE PROBLEM MANIFESTED ITSELF ONCE AGAIN.  THE CAR WAS BROUGHT TO ROBERTS AUTO MALL.  THE MECHANIC GUESSED THAT THE PROBLEM WAS AIR IN THE SYSTEM.  WE WERE CHARGED $63.49 FOR DIAGNOSTICS. ON MARCH 10TH, THE CAR AGAIN OVERHEATED.  WE ARE NOW USING ONE VEHICLE WHILE OUR HONDA CIVIC SITS OUTSIDE UNUSED.  I AM UNSURE HOW TO PROCEED SINCE EVERY MECHANIC HAS SO FAR BEEN UNABLE TO REPAIR THE PROBLEM WITH THE COOLING SYSTEM. OUR COMPLAINT CAN BE SUMMARIZED AS SUCH:  THIS PROBLEM IS INTRINSIC TO THE CAR.  IT APPEARED WHILE THE CAR WAS UNDER WARRANTY AND HAS NEVER BEEN PROPERLY CORRECTED.

DEAR NHTSA             I DON'T KNOW HOW TO APPROACH YOU WITH THIS BECAUSE I HAVE NEVER DONE ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE. I AM LEASING A 2002 CRV HONDA AND HAVE BEEN VERY HAPPY WITH IT UNTIL TODAY.  WHILE I WAS COMING THROUGH MY APARTMENT COMPLEX  A LOUD CRACK CAME FROM UNDER THE VEHICLE ON THE PASSENGER SIDE.  THE VEHICLE JOLTED TO A STOP AND I GOT OUT OF THE CAR TO LOOK AROUND THE AREA OF WHERE THE NOISE CAME FROM. THE PASSENGER SIDE WHEEL APPEARED TO LOOK LIKE IT HAD SEPARATED FROM THE AXEL OR SOMETHING. THEN I LOOKED FURTHER UNDER THE VEHICLE AND SAW THAT AND ARM OR ROD TO THE WHEEL HAD BROKE IN HALF. THERE WAS AN ADDITIONAL PIECE THAT BROKE AS WELL THAT APPEARS TO TAKE PART IN THE SECURING OF THE ARM OR ROD. I AM REPORTING THIS BECAUSE I FEE THERE IS A HUGE SAFETY HAZARD REGARDING LIVES WHO PRESENTLY OWN VEHICLE TO AS WELL AS MYSELF I AM  FORTUNATE THAT I WAS ONLY GOING BETWEEN TEN TO FIFTEEN MILES PER HOUR AND WAS NOT ON THE FREEWAY AT A FASTER SPEED WHICH WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN A FATALITY OR EVEN MORE FATALITIES DEPENDING ON THE TRAFFIC AT THE TIME.,10064494,HONDA,CR-V,2002,WA,Y,Y,N,12,95645.0,T1,11.157273032157136,-0.8631211714395423,6.678869094082382,-0.6787381539474359,3.2860462323976933,-0.8762826465976485,2.2919505287513626,0.3333333333333333

CALLED MY INSURANCE COMPANY, AND IT TOOK 5 MINS. TO HAVE SOMEONE FAX OVER PROOF OF INSURANCE.  THAT WAS ALL - WAS IT THAT DIFFICULT???

"I BOUGHT THE 2002 HONDA CIVIC NEW IN OCTOBER. THE FIRST WEEK I HAD IT THEY HAD TO REPLACE THE POWER STEERING RACK AS THE CAR WAS MAKING A HORRIBLE NOISE AND WAS HARD TO TURN.  THEN, ON THREE DIFFERENT OCCASIONS THE CAR SIMPLY WOULD NOT START. IT WAS PARKED ALL THREE TIMES, I WOULD GET INTO THE CAR AND IT WOULD TURN BUT NOT START. AFTER SITTING IDLE FOR ABOUT 30 MINUTES, IT WOULD FINALLY START. THE DEALERSHIP COULD NEVER DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM, SO CONSEQUENTLY IT WAS NOT DIAGNOSED OR REPAIRED.  THEN THE CAR STARTING HAVING PROBLEMS WITH WHAT I THOUGHT WERE THE BRAKES. WHEN I WOULD SLOW DOWN, THE BRAKES WOULD GRAB AND I COULD FEEL A JOLT. THE BRAKES ALSO FELT SPONGY. I TOOK THE CAR IN, AND AGAIN, THE DEALERSHIP SAID THEY COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM. I FINALLY INSISTED THE DEALERSHIP KEEP THE CAR FOR A FEW DAYS AND DRIVE IT. AS THEY WERE DRIVING IT OUT OF THEIR GARAGE, THE BRAKES TOTALLY FAILED. THEY REPLACED THE MASTER CYLINDER 2 TIMES.  THE BRAKES STILL GRABBED, SO HARD IN FACT, THAT BOTH MY HUSBAND AND I HAVE HAD DRINKS IN OUR HANDS WHILE DRIVING AND THE DRINKS SPILLED ON US.  THE DEALERSHIP DECIDED THE GRABBING WAS AN ERRATIC DOWNSHIFT OF THE TRANSMISSION.  HONDA SAID AND I QUOTE: THIS IS A NORMAL PROBLEM WITH THE HONDA 2002 CIVICS.  THE DEALERSHIP WOULD NOT FIX THE CAR SINCE IT WAS A NORMAL PROBLEM. I STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT A NORMAL PROBLEM IS!   DURING THIS TIME,  I BEGAN PURSING THE OKLAHOMA LEMON LAW.  I TRIED TO HAVE THE DEALERSHIP BUY MY CAR BACK AND THEY SAID THEY COULDN'T BECAUSE IT HAD SO MANY PROBLEMS AND THEY COULDN'T SELL IT AS A CERTIFIED USED HONDA.

THE CAR HAS BEEN SERVICED 14 TIMES BY HONDA AND FIRESTONE (TIRE MANUFACTURER) AND MERCHANT TIRE (BALANCE). HONDA TRIED TO BALANCE THE WHEELS AND AFTER SEVERAL FAILED ATTEMPTS TOLD ME IT WAS A PROBLEM WITH FAULTY TIRES (OEM).

"GOOD AFTERNOON,    MY NAME IS LAURA SARGENT AND I AM SUBMITTING A COMPLAINT REGARDING THE HONDA CRV (YEAR 2002).  ON 6/25/2004, I WAS REAR ENDED WHILE WAITING ON A METERED FREEWAY ENTRANCE RAMP IN MILWAUKEE, WI.  THE OTHER DRIVER DID NOT KNOW THAT THE RAMP WAS METERED AND REAR ENDED MY VEHICLE BETWEEN 40 - 50 MPH; MY CAR WAS THEN PUSHED INTO THE VEHICLE IN FRONT OF ME.  ALTHOUGH IT WAS A HIGH SPEED COLLISION ON THE FRONT AND REAR, THE AIRBAG ON MY 2002 HONDA CRV DID NOT INFLATE.  I HIT MY HEAD ON THE STEERING WHEEL AND HAD FACIAL BRUISING AND A LARGE GASH ON MY FOREHEAD REQUIRING APPROXIMATELY 20 STITCHES.  MY CAR IS TOTALED; THE HOOD IS CRUSHED AND THE REAR END WAS PUSHED IN APPROXIMATELY 3 FEET.    I BOUGHT MY CRV NEW IN 2002, PARTIALLY ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT IT WAS A SAFE VEHICLE THAT WOULD PROTECT ME IN THE EVENT OF A CAR ACCIDENT.  ON FRIDAY, I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP WHERE MY CAR IS SERVICED (RUSS DARROW HONDA IN MILWAUKEE, WI) TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT I HAD NOT MISSED ANY RECALLS, AND THEY CONFIRMED THAT MY CAR WAS CURRENT WITH ALL RECALLS (THERE HAVE BEEN NO AIRBAG SPECIFIC RECALLS FOR MY YEAR).    IF MY AIRBAG HAD INFLATED, I MOST LIKELY WOULD HAVE WALKED AWAY FROM THE SCENE WITHOUT ANY LASTING REMINDERS.  MANY CONSUMERS CONSIDER A VEHICLE SAFETY RATING AND AIRBAG QUALITY WHEN CHOOSING A NEW VEHICLE.  SINCE YOU CANNOT TEST AIRBAGS EXCEPT IN A LAB ENVIRONMENT OR ACCIDENT SITUATION, CONSUMERS MUST RELY ON THE TRUSTWORTHINESS OF THE MANUFACTURER AND HOPE THAT THEY WORK WHEN REQUIRED.  I'D LIKE TO UNDERSTAND WHY MY AIRBAG DID NOT INFLATE AND I THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR OTHER CONSUMERS TO ALSO BE AWARE OF THIS SITUATION... I SEE MANY OTHER HONDA CRVS ON THE ROAD.

CAR WAS MAINTAINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH OWNER'S MANUAL AND SERVICED ALMOST ENTIRELY BY SAME DEALER FOR 5 1/2 YEARS.  NO ACCIDENT OCCURRED, BUT ALL OF THESE PROBLEMS WITHIN SUCH A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME (3-6 MONTHS BETWEEN PRIOR MAJOR AND MINOR CHECKUPS AND THE CHECKUP THAT DISCOVERED THESE PROBLEMS AND 5 1/2 YEARS FOR THE CAR AGE) ARE CAUSE FOR CONCERN, ESPECIALLY SINCE THEY COULD HAVE WORKED TOGETHER TO CAUSE A DRASTIC LOSS OF CONTROL OF THE CAR.

"THE TRANSMISSION ON OUR 2002 HONDA ODYSSEY MINIVAN BEGAN FAILING AROUND 40,000 MILES.  THE 2ND GEAR LUBRICATION RECALL  HAD BEEN PERFORMED.   ONE OF THE MODES OF FAILURE WAS THE INABILITY OF THE TRANSMISSION TO SHIFT FROM 2ND TO 3RD GEAR DURING ACCELERATION.  THE TRANSMISSION WOULD COME OUT OF 2ND BUT NOT ENGAGE 3RD GEAR AND WOULD ACT AS IF IT WERE IN NEUTRAL.    ANOTHER MODE OF FAILURE WAS THE TRANSMISSION WOULD ABRUPTLY COME OUT OF 3RD GEAR DURING ACCELERATION.    FOR BOTH OF THESE FAILURES THE ENGINE WOULD NO LONGER BE UNDER LOAD, AND RPMS WOULD DRAMATICALLY INCREASE.  THIS LOUD REVVING AND NO ACCELERATION STARTLES THE DRIVER.  BOTH OF THESE MODES OF FAILURE ARE PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS, BECAUSE THEY WOULD HAPPEN DURING ACCELERATION.  WHEN IT HAPPENED, YOU WOULD TYPICALLY BE TRYING TO CROSS A HIGHWAY, OR MERGE ONTO THE INTERSTATE.  THE DRIVER WOULD FIND THEMSELVES IN AN ACCIDENT SITUATION BECAUSE THE VEHICLE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SAFELY CROSS THE  HIGHWAY, OR MERGE WITH TRAFFIC.  ADDITIONALLY, A REAR END ACCIDENT WAS A POTENTIAL DANGER BECAUSE YOU WOULD SUDDENLY STOP ACCELERATING, CATCHING THE DRIVER BEHIND YOU OFF GUARD.  WHEN THE TRANSMISSION WAS IN NEUTRAL DURING THE FAILURE, YOU COULD NOT GET THE TRANSMISSION TO COME BACK INTO GEAR UNTIL THE VEHICLE HAD SLOWED DOWN CONSIDERABLY.    ONCE THE VEHICLE FAILED TO SHIFT BUT THIS TIME SHOWED A FAULT LIGHT ON THE DASH. THE FAULT DECODED TO AN ""IMPROPER GEAR RATIO"" MESSAGE.

HE WAS TOLD THAT THE BRAKES NEED TO BE GREASED TO HELP PREVENT THIS- SOMETHING I WAS NOT TOLD WHEN I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE.

ACCORDING TO NHTSA DEFECT INVESTIGATION #PE05043, ""IN MARCH 2006, HONDA ISSUED A SERVICE BULLETIN (06-009) TO EXTEND THE WARRANTY ON SRS ILLUMINATION AND OPDS ISSUES TO 10 YEARS OR 150,000 MILES ""  MY CURRENT MILEAGE IS 86,000 MILES AND WE HAVE OWNED THE VEHICLE FOR LESS THAN 10 YEARS.  I DID NOT RECEIVE A NOTIFICATION LETTER AND WHEN I CALLED HONDA SF TODAY TO INQUIRE, THEY TOLD ME THAT THE SERVICE WAS NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY.    IF MY VEHICLE MEETS THE CRITERIA SPECIFIED IN YOUR REPORT, WHY IS THE DEALERSHIP NOT HONORING THEIR WARRANTY EXTENSION?  TODAY, THE MAINTENANCE DEPT AT SF HONDA SUGGESTED THAT THE HORN WAS CONNECTED TO THE AIRBAG ELECTRONIC SENSORS AND THAT IF I WANTED TO FIX THE PROBLEM, THAT NO PART OF SERVICE WOULD BE COVERED UNDER WARRANTY.    I UNDERSTAND THAT IN INVESTIGATION #PE05043, YOU HAVE NOT TESTED TO SEE IF THIS DEFECT IS A VALID SAFETY ISSUE.  ARE THERE ANY CURRENT TESTS THAT COMPARE THE SAFETY STANDARDS BETWEEN HAVING A FUNCTIONING AIRBAG AND SEAT BELT VERSES JUST A FUNCTIONING SEAT BELT?    I DON'T THINK  IT'S RIGHT THAT I SHOULD PAY $1500 TO FIX THIS.  I SHOULD NOT WORRY ABOUT GETTING INTO A CRASH ESPECIALLY IF THE CAR SHOULD STILL BE COVERED UNDER THE WARRANTY EXTENSION.  ANYWAY, TO SUM IT UP.  1.  I WANT HONDA TO HONOR THE WARRANTY EXTENSION PER YOUR INVESTIGATION AND I WANT HONDA TO REPAIR MY VEHICLE FOR FREE.  2.  I WANT YOU TO INVESTIGATE TO FIND OUT WHY HONDA IS NOT HONORING THE WARRANTY EXTENSION FOR MYSELF AND POSSIBLY FOR OTHER PEOPLE.  3.  I WANT YOU TO INVESTIGATE THE SAFETY IMPLICATIONS OF THIS FAULTY SRS SYSTEM AND   TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTION TO PREVENT SERIOUS INJURY TO CURRENT HONDA OWNERS.

ALL THREE HAPPENED WITHIN 36,000 MILES.   FIRST PROBLEM WAS A SEAT BELT SENSOR PROBLEM. IT WAS DETECTED SEVERAL MONTHS ON BOTH VEHICLES. AND I ASKED A HONDA MECHANIC TO FIX IT. HE TOLD ME THAT IT WOULD GO AWAY IF YOU DROVE MORE. HOWEVER, THIS PROBLEM WAS NOT GONE. AND COUPLE OF YEARS LATER, I STRONGLY ASK HONDA DEALER TO CHECK AND FIX IT. ONE WAS SEAT BELT SENSOR PROBLEM AND THE OTHER WAS THE MAIN SEAT BELT CONTROLLER.   SECOND PROBLEM WAS A TIMING RELATED ENGINE SURGE. IT HAPPENED ON BOTH HONDAS WITHIN 30,000 MILES ON THE SAME DAY. RPM OF BOTH HONDA WENT UP AND ENGINE LIGHT WAS ON. EVEN IN BRAKING, I COULD FEEL VERY STRONG FORCE, WHICH MIGHT BREAK SOMETHING. IT WAS A SUDDEN SURGE ENOUGH TO CAUSE A BIG ACCIDENT.

I LIVE IN SOUTHEN CALIFORNIA SO RAIN IS RARE. BUT A HEAVY RAIN CAUSED THE TRUNK BECAME A POOL AND THE TRUNK MAT IS FULLY SOAKED. ALTHOUGH AT THAT TIME, THE CAR WAS STILL UNDER THE HONDA CERTIFIED WARRANTY, HONDA TOLD ME THE TRUNK SEALING IS NOT COVERED.

"AFTER PURCHASING THE EVENFLO TRIUMPH ADVANCE, I ATTEMPTED TO INSTALL IT IN MY 2002 HONDA ODYSSEY.  AFTER USING THE LATCH SYSTEM TO INSTALL THE CHILD RESTRAINT IN THE FORWARD-FACING POSITION OF MY 2ND ROW CAPTAINS CHAIR, I WAS NOT ABLE TO USE THE TOP TETHER ON THE CHILD RESTRAINT.

WHEN I CALLED EVENFLO, THEY INFORMED ME THAT I CANNOT CURRENTLY ORDER A LONGER STRAP.

HOW MANY PEOPLE IN OTHER CIVICS HAVE HAD THIS HAPPEN ON ON INTERSTATE HIGHWAY WHERE TRAFFIC AT 70 MPH COULD NOT POSSIBLY STOP.  PERHAPS WE WILL NEVER KNOW.

WE ACCEPTED THAT AS TRUTH SINCE IT WAS IN THE MANUAL THAT CAME WITH THE CAR.  OF COURSE, NOW THE PERSON I TALKED TO AT HONDA SAYS ""WELL IT SHOULD BE CHANGED EVERY 30,000 MILES"".

THE POWER SLIDING DOOR ON OUR VAN FAILED CAUSING THE DOOR TO WHIP OPEN WHILE TRAVELING ON THE INTERSTATE WITH OUR CHILDREN IN THE SEATS NEXT TO THE SUDDENLY OPEN DOOR (OUR DOG WAS ALSO IN THE VEHICLE AND COULD HAVE STEPPED OUT ONTO THE ROAD AT 65MPG)! WE HAD ZERO WARNING THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM OR THAT ANYTHING WAS WRONG. PULLING INTO A SERVICE STATION THEY WERE UNABLE TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM NOR COULD HONDA OR ITS DEALERS VIA PHONE. WE WERE FORCED TO DRIVE HOME WITH THE DOOR TAPED FROM THE OUTSIDE AND TRAVELING AT LOW SPEEDS SO THE DOOR WOULD NOT OPEN ON THE HIGHWAY ONCE AGAIN.

WHY THERE IS NOT A RECALL WHEN SOMETHING THIS DANGEROUS COULD HAPPEN AND IS THIS COMMON IS WHY I AM WRITING. I AM AFRAID TO DRIVE THE 35 MILES TO THE DEALERSHIP!!!

WE DID NOT USE AAA TO TOW THE VEHICLE SINCE WE WERE AT A SERVICE STATION AND THEY CALLED AROUND FOR US TO TRY AND GET A SOLUTION.

"OUR 2002 HONDA ODYSSEY'S TRANSMISSION STARTED DOWNSHIFTING ON IT'S OWN  WHEN THE MILEAGE WAS AT 70,500.  THIS DECELERATION USUALLY OCCURS WHEN GOING INTO SECOND GEAR, BUT HAS ALSO HAPPENED AT HIGHER SPEEDS.  IT OCCURS SEVERAL OR MORE TIMES  EVERYTIME WE DRIVE THE CAR (WHICH IS EVERYDAY).  WE HAVE THREE CHILDREN WHO TRAVEL IN THIS VAN DAILY, AND AFTER READING ALL THE REPORTS ON THE INTERNET, WE ARE EXTREMELY CONCERNED FOR THEIR SAFETY.  IN ONE RECENT INCIDENT A SEMI TRUCK WAS TRAVELING AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED BEHIND US.  AS I ATTEMPTED TO SWITCH LANES TO AVOID BEING REAR ENDED, OUR HONDA DECELERATED, AND WHEN I PUSHED HARDER ON THE ACCELERATOR, IT DID NOT RESPOND.  LUCKILY A CAR IN THE NEXT LANE SLOWED DOWN TO LET US OVER, AND WE WERE ABLE TO AVOID A SERIOUS ACCIDENT.      WE HAVE TAKEN OUR HONDA INTO THE DEALER FIVE TIMES IN THE LAST YEAR FOR THIS PROBLEM.   THEY STATED THEY WERE ""UNABLE TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM"" WHEN THEY DROVE THE VAN. THE VEHICLE HAS COMPLETELY BROKEN DOWN ON TWO OCCASIONS , AND THEY REPLACED THE BATTERY AND ALTERNATOR (8-07), ALTERNATOR BELT -DUE TO BROKEN BRACKET (6-08).  RIGHT BEFORE IT BROKE DOWN ON THESE OCCASIONS, THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT AND OTHER DASH LIGHTS WERE FLASHING, AND THE SPEEDOMETER NEEDLE WAS BOUNCING ALL OVER THE PLACE.  IT WAS BROUGHT BACK TO THE DEALER ON 8-21-08 DUE TO ANOTHER BREAKDOWN  AS DESCRIBED ABOVE.  THEY CLAIM IT NEEDS A NEW BATTERY , ALTERNATOR BELT, AND TWO NEW ALTERNATOR BRACKETS.         HONDA IS OBVIOUSLY BUYING THEMSELVES TIME BY FIXING THE ""MINOR ISSUES"" IN HOPES THAT WE WILL BE ANOTHER CUSTOMER WHO CRAWLS TO THE 100,000 MILE MARK WHEN OUR WARRANTY EXPIRES AND WE'RE INFORMED OUR TRANSMISSION MYSTERIOUSLY NEEDS TO BE REPLACED. UNFORTUNATELY, IF WE KEEP THIS VEHICLE WE'LL BE PAYING FOR IT SINCE IT IS NO LONGER COVERED UNDER THE WARRANTY.

"DURING MY DRIVE TO WORK THE OTHER MORNING MY CAR SUDDEN JERKED BACK AND FORTH ON THE FREEWAY.  IT WAS VERY SUDDEN AND IT WAS VERY SCARY, I HAD NOT CONTROL OVER THE VEHICLE. THE TIRES WERE SCREECHING DURING THE JERKS AND I WAS AFRAID I WAS GOING TO CRASH.  A CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AS WELL AS A VSC LIGHT AND MY SHIFTER LIKE D5 WAS BLINKING.  I MADE IT TO WORK AND CALLED MY BOYFRIEND TO COME LOOK AT THE VEHICLE.  HE DROVE IT AROUND THE BLOCK AND NOTICED NOTHING WRONG,  BETTER SAFE THAN SORRY WE SWITCHED CARS.  ON HIS DRIVE HOME HE FELT THE SAME THING I DID, VERY SUDDEN JERK AND UNCONTROLLABLE CAR ON THE FREEWAY.  HE MENTIONED IT WAS LIKE THE TRANSMISSION LOCKING UP AND THEN THE TRACTION CONTROL GRABBING.  THE CAR WOULD NOT SHIFT GEARS. HE IMMEDIATELY DROVE IT STRAIGHT TO ACURA AND FOUND SOMEBODY TO LOOK AT IT.  THE DEALERSHIP SAID THAT IT WAS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THESE CARS AND ITS A TICKING TIME BOMB AND THERE WAS A RECALL AND EXTENDED WARRANTY ISSUED OUT BY ACURA, THE DEALERSHIP ALSO SAID THAT THE VIN NUMBER OF MY VEHICLE WAS OUT OF THE RANGE OF THE WARRANTY. THEY ARE OFFERING TO COVER 60% OF THE COST FOR THE TRANSMISSION REPLACEMENT AND I PAY 40%.

"MY CASE IS VERY SIMILAR TO ODI ID NUMBER: 10251868.  I WAS DRIVING ON THE FREEWAY.  THE ENGINE OVERHEATED AND IT WAS FOUND THAT THE UPPER RADIATOR HOSE BURST.  ENGINE OIL LEAKED INTO THE COOLING SYSTEM ALSO.    THE HONDA DEALER TORN DOWN THE ENGINE, AND DID A SERIES OF INSPECTIONS, LEAK DOWN TEST, AND PRESSURE TEST.  NO VISIBLE SIGN OF A BLOWN HEAD GASKET.  NO SIGNS OF WARPING AND/OR CRACKS ON THE CYLINDER HEAD.    THE SERVICE MANAGER SAID IT IS PROBABLY DUE TO A VERY POROUS CYLINDER HEAD.  THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE FOR THE ENGINE OVERHEATING IS AS FOLLOWS:  THE POROUS CYLINDER HEAD ALLOWED ENGINE OIL TO LEAK INTO THE COOLING SYSTEM.  THE OIL DETERIORATED THE RUBBER GASKET ON THE THERMOSTAT.  (THIS WAS INDICATED BY FRESH ENGINE OIL RESIDUE FOUND ON THE DAMAGED RUBBER GASKET OF THE ORIGINAL THERMOSTAT.)   THE DETERIORATED RUBBER GASKET BLOCKED THE FLOW OF THE COOLANT.  WITHOUT ENOUGH FLOW RATE TO COOL DOWN THE SYSTEM, THE COOLANT BOILED INSIDE THE HOSES.  PRESSURE BUILT UP, AND THE UPPER RADIATOR HOSE BURST.  COOLANT LEAKED OUT FROM THE DAMAGED HOSE, AND THE ENGINE OVERHEATED.  THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THE CAR HAS THIS PROBLEM.  IT HAS NO MAJOR PROBLEMS BEFORE.  I COMPLETED ALL NECESSARY MAINTENANCE ON TIME ACCORDING TO THE OWNER'S MANUAL.  ALL MAJOR MAINTENANCE SERVICES WERE PERFORMED BY THE DEALER.

"MY VEHICLE IS A 2002 HONDA ODYSSEY EX-L. THE VEHICLE WAS SUBJECT TO A RECALL FOR ITS AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION (NHTSA CAMPAIGN ID NUMBER: 04V176000). RECALL SERVICE WAS PERFORMED FOR MY VEHICLE BY REPLACEMENT OF THE ORIGINAL TRANSMISSION IN 2005. I HAD NOT NOTICED ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN PERFORMANCE SINCE I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE IN 2006 THAT ALERTED ME TO ANY NEW PROBLEMS WITH THE TRANSMISSION.    WHEN THE INCIDENT OCCURRED, I WAS DRIVING THE VEHICLE ON THE INTERSTATE AT 62 MPH.  SPOUSE AND FOUR YOUNG CHILDREN WERE PASSENGERS. WITHOUT WARNING, A LOUD ""CLUNK"" WAS AUDIBLE FROM THE ENGINE AND THE VEHICLE LURCHED, AFTER WHICH THE TRANSMISSION COMPLETELY LOCKED, THE FRONT WHEELS QUIT TURNING, AND THE VEHICLE SKIDDED TO A STOP WITHIN AROUND 100 YARDS OR LESS FROM THE INITIAL POINT OF FAILURE. THE FRONT TIRES WERE SMOKING AND NEARLY BURNING WHEN THE VEHICLE CAME TO REST, HAVING BEEN WORN DOWN TO THE BELTS DESPITE THEM BEING ONLY ABOUT ONE YEAR OLD. IT WAS LATER DETERMINED BY THE DEALER THAT WHEN THE TRANSMISSION LOCKED, IT ALSO CAUSED THE ENGINE BLOCK TO CRACK, THE SHIFT CABLE SNAPPED, AND THE RIGHT AXLE WAS BROKEN INTO TWO PIECES. AMERICAN HONDA AGREED TO INSTALL A REMANUFACTURED TRANSMISSION, A SALVAGE ENGINE, NEW RIGHT AND LEFT AXLE ASSEMBLIES, AND NEW FRONT TIRES. THE DEALER WAS INSTRUCTED TO SEND THE TRANSMISSION BACK TO HONDA.    I WAS ABLE TO MAINTAIN ONLY VERY LIMITED CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE WHEN THE FRONT WHEELS  LOCKED, AND IT IS REMARKABLE THAT THERE WAS NO CRASH, INJURIES, OR FATALITIES CONSIDERING THAT THIS OCCURRED AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS IN A NARROW URBAN CONSTRUCTION ZONE WITH MODERATE TRAFFIC.

"I OWN A 2001 HONDA CIVIC LX SEDAN. THE CAR HAS ABOUT 81000 MILES ON IT.     ON MAY 2ND 2009, THE CAR JUST STOPPED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD AND THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON.

THE TOTAL COST TO REPAIR THE VEHICLE WAS $2609. THE VEHICLE THAT WAS STRUCK ALSO NEEDED REPAIR. IT SUSTAINED DAMAGE TO THE REAR BUMPER AND TAIL LIGHTS.       UPON LEARNING OF OTHER HONDAS HAVING THIS PROBLEM AND BEING RECALLED, I CONTACTED HONDA MANUFACTURER WHOSE REPRESENTATIVE CHECKED THE VIN NUMBER OF OUR VEHICLE AND INFORMED ME THE RECALL DIDN'T APPLY TO 2002 HONDA ACCORDS. I THEN SPOKE TO  A NHTSA REPRESENTATIVE WHO INFORMED ME THE RECALL DID APPLY TO SOME 2002 HONDA ACCORDS BUT THAT IT WAS VIN-SPECIFIC. I THEN SPOKE TO A SECOND HONDA REPRESENTATIVE WHO AGREED IT APPLIED TO SOME 2002 HONDA ACCORDS BUT THAT IT WAS VIN-SPECIFIC AND IT DIDN'T APPLY TO OUR CAR. I AM PERPLEXED THAT MY CAR WAS NOT PART OF THE RECALL EVEN THOUGH IT HAS THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM AS OTHER HONDA ACCORDS THAT WERE RECALLED.

"SO, THE REPORT FOR PE02081 SAYS THAT THE TRANSMISSION PROBLEM FOR THE 2000-2003 ACURA TL / CL IS RARE AND ERRONEOUS AND ISN'T REALISTIC, BUT I'VE DONE A LOT OF RESEARCH AND I AM A MEMBER OF ACURAZINE.COM. BUT I AM HAVING THE SAME ISSUES AS WAS LISTED (I.E. SLIPPING OF GEARS, SUDDEN HARSH DOWNSHIFT FROM 65MPH TO REDLINE LIMIT AT 50MPH ON FREEWAY NEARLY CAUSING AN ACCIDENT). AFTER THE INCIDENT I HAD TAKEN MY VEHICLE TO DEALERSHIP BECAUSE I WAS TOLD THERE HAD BEEN AN EXTENDED WARRANTY ON THE VEHICLE TO 109,000 MILES. I WAS AT NEARLY 108,000 MILES WHEN MY CAR WAS AT THE DEALERSHIP. THAT WAS WHEN THE SERVICE GENTLEMAN TOLD ME I NEEDED TO REPLACE MY TRANSMISSION WHICH WOULD COST ABOUT $3800 BECAUSE I HAD BEEN AFTER THE CUT-OFF POINT FOR THE EXTENDED WARRANTY. THAT SERVICE WAS DENIED AND THEY SENT ME ON MY WAY EVEN THOUGH I WAS HAVING THE EXACT SAME PROBLEMS AS THE VEHICLES THAT WERE BEFORE THE VIN # CUT-OFF. I HAVE SINCE, THEN, REPLACED MY TRANSMISSION WITH ANOTHER SHOP FOR $3500 BUT ONLY AFTER LOSING MY JOB AND FAILING MY COLLEGE CLASSES FOR THE SEMESTER BECAUSE I COULD NOT AFFORD TO REPAIR MY CAR AT THE TIME. I WISH SOMEONE WOULD HOLD THE ACURA CORPORATION RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR MISTAKE AND FOR THE SAFETY OF EVERY OTHER DRIVER ON THE ROAD. IF YOU LOOK ON ACURAZINE.COM, THERE IS A TRANSMISSION (TRANNY) FAILURE THREAD THAT GOES ON FOR 64 PAGES WITH OTHER OWNERS OF THE SAME VEHICLE HAVING THE SAME PROBLEMS AND NOT RECEIVING HELP FROM ACURA JUST LIKE ME. I KNOW THERE WAS A CLASS ACTION LAW-SUIT IN 2006 FOR THIS ISSUE AND I FEEL THERE WILL BE ANOTHER LAW-SUIT AGAINST THEM IF THIS PROBLEM IS NOT TREATED CORRECTLY. I ALSO KNOW THAT ACURA/HONDA MANUFACTURES THEIR OWN TRANSMISSIONS, UNLIKE A LOT IF NOT ALL OF THE OTHER CAR MAKERS WHOM USE UNIVERSAL TRANSMISSIONS.

"MY 2002 HONDA ACCORD LX-V6 HAS DEVELOPED PREMATURE FAILURE OF BOTH THE FRONT AND SIDE MOTOR MOUNTS.   THIS IS A KNOWN DEFECT OF HONDA V6 VEHICLES, FOR WHICH HONDA HAS ISSUED A TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN (TSB).   MOTOR MOUNTS ARE NOT A NORMAL MAINTENANCE ITEM; THEY ARE NOT LISTED IN THE HONDA RECOMMENDED MAINTENANCE SCHEDULE FOR HONDA ACCORDS UP TO 120,000 MILES AS AN ITEM THAT NEEDS TO BE REPLACED OR INSPECTED.   MANY EXPERTS SUGGEST THAT MOTOR MOUNTS SHOULD OUTLAST THE LIFE OF THE CAR; HENCE THIS CLEARLY REPRESENTS A PREMATURE FAILURE OF A CRITICAL ENGINE SAFETY COMPONENT.         THE BROKEN MOTOR MOUNTS REPRESENT A ¿SAFETY-RELATED DEFECT¿ AS DESCRIBED IN THE U.S. CODE FOR MOTOR VEHICLE SAFETY (TITLE 49, CHAPTER 301).   A SAFETY DEFECT IS DEFINED AS A PROBLEM THAT EXISTS IN A MOTOR VEHICLE OR ITEM OF MOTOR VEHICLE EQUIPMENT THAT POSES AN RISK TO MOTOR VEHICLE SAFETY, AND MAY EXIST IN A GROUP OF VEHICLES OF THE SAME DESIGN OR MANUFACTURE, OR ITEMS OF EQUIPMENT OF THE SAME TYPE AND MANUFACTURE.     BROKEN MOTOR MOUNTS (ENGINE MOUNTS) ARE DANGEROUS AND COULD LEAD TO CATASTROPHIC FAILURE AT HIGH SPEED DUE TO WEDGED LINKAGES CAUSING UNINTENDED ACCELERATION AND LOSS OF VEHICLE CONTROL.  DRIVING WITH DAMAGED ENGINE MOUNTS CAN BE VERY DANGEROUS.   THE ENGINE CAN ALSO SPIN FRONT WARD AND DAMAGE THE RADIATOR WITH THE FAN BLADES.

I MADE THE DEALERSHIP AWARE OF THIS AND THEY REFUSED TO ACKNOWLEDGE A MANUFACTURER PROBLEM AND I HAD TO PAY FOR REPAIRS IN ORDER TO PASS INSPECTION.   IN THE SPRING OF 2006 HONDA FINALLY ACKNOWLEDGE A PROBLEM AND SENT NOTIFICATION TO OWNERS.  I WAS REIMBURSED FOR THE MONEY I HAD PAID FOR REPAIRS.  GIVEN THE PROBLEMS THAT HAD BEEN REPORTED THEY EXTENDED THE WARRANTY ON THIS PART FOR ALL OWNERS.  UNFORTUNATELY, A MALFUNCTION OF THE SRS HAPPENED AGAIN IN 2006.  AGAIN I HAD TO PAY OUT OF POCKET FOR REPAIRS.  AGAIN I SUBMITTED THE INFORMATION TO HONDA AND WAS REIMBURSED.  FINALLY, IN 2009 ANOTHER PROBLEM WITH THE SRS WAS DISCOVERED.

"MY 2002 HONDA CR-V HAS A FUEL FILLER DEFECT WHICH CAUSES THE ""CHECK ENGINE"" LIGHT TO COME ON. CHANGES IN TEMPERATURE OR OTHER WEATHER RELATED FACTORS CAUSE  THE FILLER CAP TO LOOSEN AND THE LIGHT COMES ON. HONDA RECOMMENDS MANUALLY TIGHTENING THE CAP  PAST ""SEVERAL CLICKS"" TO ENSURE A TIGHT SEAL AFTER FUELING. THE CAP LOOSENS ANYWAY ACCOMPANIED BY STRONG GASOLINE FUMES FROM THE LOOSENED CAP. HONDA KNOWS OF THE PROBLEM. THEY REPLACED THE FUEL CAP TWICE AND ONCE GAVE ME A $ 300 ESTIMATE TO REPLACE THE PLASTIC GAS TANK FILLER PIPE WHICH IS APPARENTLY THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM. TODAY WAS A WARM DAY AND THE LIGHT WAS ON ALL DAY AS I DROVE.

"I HAD 4 BRIDGESTONE POTENZA RE960AS POLE POSITION SIZE 215/50R17 TIRES INSTALLED IN MAY OF 2008 ON MY 2002 ACURA TL TYPE S VEHICLE.  TWO SEPARATE DEFECTS.    1.  I WAS FORCED TO REPLACE ONE TIRE IN JANUARY OF 2010.  I REPLACED THE DEFECTIVE TIRE UNDER ROAD HAZARD INSURANCE DUE TO A DEFECT IN THE SIDEWALL.      2.  ON FEBRUARY 3, 2011 I HAD A CATASTROPHIC TIRE FAILURE ON INTERSTATE 64 IN ST. LOUIS.  THE TIRE DIDN'T JUST BLOW OUT, IT HAD FULL TREAD SEPARATION.  THE HIGHWAY WAS CLEAR OF ALL SNOW AND SLUSH IN THE LOCATION WHERE THE FAILURE OCCURRED.  MY ESTIMATED SPEED WAS 50 MPH AT THE TIME OF THE FAILURE.  THE OUTSIDE TEMPERATURE WAS 9 DEGREES ABOVE ZERO.  I WAS NOT IN A TURN, AND DID NOT HIT ANY ROAD HAZARDS.  THE TIRES ON MY VEHICLE WERE INFLATED PROPERLY.  THE SHOP REPORTED THAT THE OTHER TIRES HAD VERY EVEN TIRE WEAR, SUGGESTING THAT THE WHEELS WERE ALIGNED PROPERLY, THE SUSPENSION WAS OPERATING PROPERLY, AND THE TIRES WERE INFLATED PROPERLY.    THE RESULTING DAMAGE TO MY VEHICLE WAS SEVERE DAMAGE TO THE LEFT REAR ALLOY WHEEL, THE DEFECTIVE TIRE, AND THE NEED FOR A WHEEL ALIGNMENT DUE TO THE CAR RIDING ON THE ALLOY WHEEL.    I CONTACTED BRIDGESTONE, AND WAS GIVEN THE RUNAROUND.  THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT BRIDGESTONE DID NOT WANT TO HELP ME IN ANY WAY.  THE BRIDGESTONE LAWYER TOLD ME ON FEBRUARY 4, 2011, THAT THEY HAD ALREADY LOOKED AT THE TIRE.  I CONTACTED THE SHOP, AND BRIDGESTONE DID NOT LOOK AT THE TIRE.  I INFORMED THE LAWYER THAT THEY COULD FIND THE REST OF MY TIRE ON TOP OF A SNOW BANK ON I-64 BETWEEN KINGSHIGHWAY AND GRAND AVENUE.  THE TREAD WAS INTACT, AND IN ONE PIECE.  SHE DID NOT SEEM INTERESTED IN SEEING THE TREAD, SUGGESTING THAT BRIDGESTONE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE ENOUGH TO INVESTIGATE PROBLEMS ON THEIR OWN, AND NEED A GOVERNMENT WATCH DOG TO FORCE THEM TO LOOK INTO DEFECTS.

"MY 2001 HONDA CIVIC WAS PART OF A RECALL DUE TO A PROBLEM WITH THE SRS. I WENT TO THE DEALERSHIP AND I WAS TOLD THAT MY CAR WAS ALSO UNDER RECALL DUE TO A PROBLEM WITH THE SWITCH FOR THE LIGHTS. THE PROBLEM WAS WITH THE LOW-BEAMS. I MADE AN APPOINTMENT FOR BOTH TO BE FIXED. WHEN I BROUGHT THE CAR IN, I WAS TOLD THAT IT WAS NOT PART OF THE RECALL FOR THE LIGHTSWITCH, ALTHOUGH THE RECALL CONTAINED THE MAKE AND MODEL YEAR OF MY CAR. I AM DISAPPOINTED THAT THIS WASN'T FIXED AS PART OF THE RECALL BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING PROBLEMS WITH THE SWITCH, GOING SO FAR AS TO PURCHASE TWO SETS OF HEADLIGHTS IN THE TWO YEARS I HAVE OWNED THE CAR, AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY IF IT OCCURRED IN OTHER CARS MADE THE SAME YEAR AS MINE, WHY WOULDN'T HONDA FIX IT KNOWING IT HAS BEEN A PROBLEM.  MY VIN APPARENTLY WAS A FEW NUMBERS OFF. I WOULD THINK THAT IF I'M HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM, HONDA WOULD FIX MY SWITCH EVEN THOUGH IT ISN'T WITHIN THE RECALLED VIN RANGE. MY SECOND COMPLAINT IS THAT AFTER HAVING REPLACED THE RECALLED PART, THE SRS INDICATOR LIGHT IS STILL ON. THIS DEALERSHIP ALLOWED ME TO DRIVE AWAY IN MY UNSAFE CAR, WHICH WILL NOT PASS INSPECTION DUE TO THE SAFETY ISSUE. THE FINAL ISSUE IS THAT I WAS PROMISED THE CAR AT 1 O'CLOCK, AND I DIDN'T GET A CALL THAT IT WAS FINISHED UNTIL ALMOST 2 O'CLOCK, AND AT THAT TIME I HAD TO SCRAMBLE TO FIND SOMEONE AT THE VERY LAST MINUTE TO PICK UP MY CHILD FROM SCHOOL.

IT IS CLEAR THAT HONDA KNEW THIS WAS A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE BUT DID NOT ELECT TO MAKE A RECALL. I BELIEVE HONDA EXTENDED THE WARRANTY TO SAVE MONEY AS HONDA KNEW THAT MANY PEOPLE DO NOT KEEP THEIR CARS MORE THAN 10 YEARS (OR FOR 150,000 MILES) AND SECONDARY BUYERS MAY NOT BE AWARE OF THE EXTENDED WARRANTY IF THESES ITEMS MALFUNCTIONED DURING THE WARRANTY PERIOD. I CONTACTED HONDA CUSTOMER SERVICE TO SEE IF THEY WOULD GIVE ME SOME CONSIDERATION AND THEY SAID THE WARRANTY EXPIRED IN 2010 AND I HAD TO PAY FOR THE REPAIRS. I BELIEVE THAT IT IS UNCONSCIONABLE FOR HONDA NOT TO HAVE HAD A RECALL IN 2006 FOR THIS ISSUE AS HAVING THE POSSIBILITY OF AN AIRBAG NOT WORKING PROPERLY COULD CAUSE SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH.

"DEAR SIR OR MADAM:  I TOOK MY 2001 HONDA ACCORD V6 TO HONDA DEALER ([XXX]  OF FRISCO, TX) FOR AIRBAG RECALL ON OCT 27, 2014. I WAS ALSO GETTING ENGINE WARNING SIGN ON MY DASH BOARD. AFTER AIRBAG REPAIR I RETURNED HOME AND  FOUND FOLLOWING COMMENT ON MY INVOICE :     ""REDESIGNED AIRBAG INFLATORS ARE NOT AVAILABLE FOR INSTALLATION AT THIS TIME.""     NEXT DAY I CALLED THE DEALER AND AMERICAN HONDA. DEALER HAS NOT RESPONDED TO MY VOICEMAIL AND AMERICAN HONDA CUSTOMER SERVICE SAID THEY WILL RESPOND WITHIN 24-48 HOURS. SO FAR NO ONE HAS REACHED OUT TO ME. MY QUESTION TO THEM WAS IF YOU DID NOT HAVE THE REDESIGNED AIRBAG INFLATORS THEN HOW HAVE YOU FIXED THE AIRBAG RECALL ISSUE.    REGARDING DASHBOARD ENGINE WARNING SIGN DEALER SAID I NEED TO INSTALL EGA PIPE KIT TO AVOID CLOGGING OF EGA PORT. HONDA IS AWARE OF THIS ISSUE AS PER THEIR SERVICE BULLETIN 99-085 AND WERE SUPPOSED TO INSTALL THE EGA PIPE KIT FREE OF COST. HONDA NEVER SENT ME ANY COMMUNICATION NOR ANY OF PAST HONDA DEALERS INFORMED ME ABOUT THIS PROBLEM. THE DEALER ASKED ME $650 TO FIX THE PROBLEM AND EVEN CHARGED ME $107 FOR DIAGNOSIS OF THIS PROBLEM WHICH WAS DIAGNOSED EARLIER BY AUTOZONE TECHNICIAN IN JUST 1 MINUTE FOR FREE.    HONDA DEALER EVEN REFUSED TO DO STATE INSPECTION SAYING MY CAR WILL FAIL THE INSPECTION IF THIS KIT IS NOT INSTALLED. I ASKED BOTH AMERICAN HONDA AND DEALER TO INSTALL EGR KIT FOR FREE SINCE IT'S A DESIGN ISSUE WITH THEIR ENGINE BUT SO FAR BOTH OF THEM HAVE REFUSED TO INSTALL IT FOR FREE.    I WOULD REQUEST YOU TO TAKE THESE ISSUES WITH HONDA ESPECIALLY THE AIRBAG, EGR PORT ISSUE AND LACK OF  COMMUNICATION REGARDING PROBLEMS IN THEIR CARS.

"WE ARE FILING A VEHICLE SAFETY COMPLAINT AGAINST AMERICAN HONDA COMPANY/TAKATA FOR THEIR DEFECTIVE AIRBAGS IN THE 2001 HONDA CIVIC CAR.  WE MADE CONTACT WITH AMERICAN HONDA COMPANY LAST YEAR ABOUT THE SEVERE INJURIES THAT THE DEPLOYED AIRBAG CAUSED TO MY WIFE AND THEY ARE NOT TAKING ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR DEFECTIVE PRODUCT.  ON 11/14/2013, A NEGLIGENT DRIVER CAUSED A SERIOUS ACCIDENT THAT PUT MY WIFE'S LIFE IN GRAVE DANGER. MY WIFE WAS WEARING HER SEAT BELT AND AIRBAGS WERE DEPLOYED. MY WIFE IMMEDIATELY FELT PAIN IN HER ENTIRE BODY AND COULDN'T MOVE.  POLICE AND PARAMEDICS WERE CALLED AND SHE WAS TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL FOR TREATMENT.  UPON MEDICAL EXAMINATION IT WAS DETERMINED THAT SHE HAD A THORACIC BURST FRACTURE AT T12 AND A T11 COMPRESSION FRACTURE, FRACTURE TO R LAMINA AND PARS OF T12 AS WELL. SHE HAD A RIB FRACTURE AND PULMONARY CONTUSION.  THESE WERE LIFE-THREATENING INJURIES.  SHE NEEDED TO HAVE IMMEDIATE SPINAL FUSION SURGERY FOR THE T10-L2 AREA OF HER SPINE.  WE FILED A COMPLAINT WITH AMERICAN HONDA COMPANY AND PROVIDED DOCUMENTS THROUGH FAXES AND EMAIL AND EACH TIME THEY SAID THEY DID NOT RECEIVE OUR DOCUMENTS. THEY CONSISTENTLY SAID THEY DID NOT RECEIVE OUR DOCUMENTS, ALTHOUGH WE HAVE FAX CONFIRMATION AND EMAIL SHOWING THAT DOCUMENTS WERE SENT SUCCESSFULLY TO AMERICAN HONDA. THEN ON 1/21/2015 MARION COOLEY FROM AMERICAN HONDA COMPANY CALLED AND SAID THEY CANNOT PROVIDE MY WIFE WITH COMPENSATION FOR HER MEDICAL INJURIES.  IT DIDN'T SEEM LIKE AMERICAN HONDA COMPANY DID ANY INVESTIGATION AND THEY WERE NOT WILLING TO ACCOMMODATE US.
